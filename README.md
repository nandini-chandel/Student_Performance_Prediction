**Student Performance Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict final grade of the student from features as study time, failures, free time, absences, health status, going out, first period grade, second period grade etc.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data visualization
- Step 3: Data training
- Step 4: Model Creation
- Step 5: Performance Evaluation

**MODELS USED**
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data training, importing models and performance check)

**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model  
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  84.94
 ``` 
- By using Lasso Regression model  
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  83.16
 ``` 
- By using Decision Tree Regressor model  
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.94
 ``` 
- By using Random Forest Regressor model  
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  97.51
 ```

* Accuracy of Decision Tree Regressor is higher than that of Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
